We've all experienced the new form of logging into your account where you log in by scanning a QR code from a mobile app. The first time I interacted with it was with Discord. By now millions of people have been on this üëá page to experience this amazing platform.

Besides beautifully crafted graphics, you can observe a QR code that you can scan using the discord mobile app to log in instantly.
In this article, I'll show you my approach that I reverse-engineered to achieve the same login experience in my application.

## ‚ùì What we're going to¬†build?

In this article, I'll explain my approach to adding a QR code login. The app built as a reference has two main screens. Let's briefly discuss what it does.
Suppose a user is logged in on Device A and wants to log in on Device B. On Device A, the user will navigate to the page to enter (for simplicity; since both clients are browser based) a code shown on Device B's login screen. On success, the user will be automatically logged in on Device B.

## üë©‚Äçüíª What's the¬†stack?

In this article, I am going to use the following stack but you should be able to mimic this approach with any backend and frontend technology out there.

### Backend

- Django
- Redis
- PostgreSQL

### Frontend

- Nextjs (React/Typescript)
